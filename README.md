# sql-challenge
For this challenge I relied on what we learned in class, as well as past experience I have with SQL from grad school. I took a database design course (intro level) in 2013, and so some of the querying felt pretty familiar. I also had a tutoring session with Kourt Bailey which helped me with the entity relationship modeling portion of the homework.
